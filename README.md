# Pathologic 1 dialogue tree extractor
Anyone who has ever looked up Pathologic's dialogues, may have found [this amazing website](https://pathologicdialogue.github.io/) which has all the dialogues from the different versions of the game separated by languages, games and characters.
And also, if you've ever been involved in the process of (fan) translating Pathologic 1, you will know the pain it is to do so merely because of how unordered the dialogues are.
<br><br>
I'm helping with the spanish translation of the game and since spanish is a gendered language and has a formal way of using the second-person singular (usted) such as russian does (Bы), it is quite important to know the context of what you are translating. Looking up said context in that amazing dialogue tree website was... tedious, to say the least.
<br><br>
This is the reason I decided to make a pdf with all those dialogues. The github for that website is [this one](https://github.com/pathologicdialogue/pathologicdialogue.github.io), thanks to that I was able to extract the dialogues inside the .html files, both in english and russian, with a little python script.
<br>
The .txt file is the product of executing the script. If you wanted to execute it to maybe extract a different language, just download dialogue tree repository, put the script in the file of the language you want and ta-dá.
The pdf file adds some personalization made with LibreOffice, an easy automated (but slow because of my laptop) process.
